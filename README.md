# Attoya Press Core

This document is a work in progress.


## Purpose

Wordpress makes it easy to build websites, however it's a nightmare for developers who want to control a proper release cycle and maintenance.
Apurna Press is a version of WordPress that is focused on deploying projects in a controlled manner and to standardize managing multiple WP websites.

To do this, we've worked out we need 2 repos. The Core repo, which is effectively WordPress, and a Client repo which is all the files needed for an instance of a WP website.
